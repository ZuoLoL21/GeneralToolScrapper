Perfect! The evaluators module has been successfully implemented. Here's a
  summary:

  Implementation Complete ✓

  I've successfully implemented the entire evaluators module for GeneralToolScraper
   following the plan. Here's what was created:

  Files Created:

  Core Evaluators (src/evaluators/):
  1. base.py - Protocol definition for evaluator contract
  2. stats_generator.py - Compute global/category statistics for normalization
  3. security.py - Security evaluator (vulnerability-based scoring)
  4. trust.py - Trust evaluator (publisher reputation)
  5. maintenance.py - Maintenance evaluator (update recency)
  6. popularity.py - Popularity evaluator (log-transform + Z-score normalization)
  7. composite.py - Composite scoring and dominance analysis
  8. registry.py - Orchestration layer for all evaluators
  9. __init__.py - Module exports (12 public APIs)

  Tests:
  10. tests/test_stats_generator.py - Statistics computation tests (10 test cases)
  11. tests/test_evaluators.py - Evaluator tests (24 test cases)
  12. tests/conftest.py - Updated with sample_stats and sample_context fixtures

  Key Features:

  ✓ Stateless Design - Pure functions (Tool + EvalContext → score)
  ✓ Four Dimensions - Popularity, Security, Maintenance, Trust
  ✓ Z-Score Normalization - Category-aware popularity scoring using scipy
  ✓ Blocking Logic - Critical vulnerabilities auto-exclude tools
  ✓ Score Analysis - Detects dominant dimensions (balanced vs. skewed)
  ✓ Complete Test Coverage - All 197 tests passing
  ✓ Demo Functions - Each module has a main() demonstrating usage

  Scoring Algorithms:

  - Security: 100 - (critical×60 + high×10 + medium×1 + low×0.5)
  - Trust: Base scores by type (Official=100, Verified=90, Company=70, User=60) +
  community bonus
  - Maintenance: Staleness ratio relative to update frequency
  - Popularity: Log-transform → Z-score → CDF (using scipy.stats.norm)

  Test Results:

  197 tests passed
  - 10 stats generator tests
  - 24 evaluator tests
  - 163 existing tests (all still passing)

  Example Usage:

  from src.evaluators import EvaluatorRegistry, generate_all_stats
  from src.models.model_stats import EvalContext

  # Generate statistics
  global_stats, category_stats = generate_all_stats(tools)

  # Create context
  context = EvalContext(
      global_stats=global_stats,
      category_stats=category_stats,
      weights=ScoreWeights(),
      score_version="1.0"
  )

  # Evaluate tools
  registry = EvaluatorRegistry()
  scored_tools = registry.evaluate_batch(tools, context)

  All evaluators follow the SCORING.md specification exactly and are ready for
  integration with the rest of the GeneralToolScraper pipeline!


  =========================================

  Perfect! I've successfully implemented the pre/post filtering logic as specified in the plan. Here's what was created:

  Files Created

  1. src/filters/init.py - Module exports for PreFilter and PostFilter
  2. src/filters/pre_filter.py - Pre-filtering logic (599 lines)
  3. src/filters/post_filter.py - Post-filtering logic (391 lines)

  Implementation Summary

  PreFilter (src/filters/pre_filter.py:18-143)

  Filters obvious junk before statistics computation to prevent pollution of category distributions:

  Exclusion checks:
  - Zero metrics (downloads == 0 AND stars == 0)
  - Deprecated tools
  - Spam patterns in name/description (test, demo, example, placeholder, etc.)
  - Low-activity forks (placeholder for future GitHub implementation)

  Test results: Successfully filtered 4/6 test tools (2 valid tools passed)

  PostFilter (src/filters/post_filter.py:18-165)

  Applies policy-based filtering after scoring using computed quality scores:

  Exclusion checks (never shown):
  - Stale tools (>365 days since update)
  - Low downloads (<1000) or low stars (<100)
  - Very low score (<15.0, half of min_score)

  Hidden checks (shown with --include-hidden):
  - Experimental lifecycle
  - Legacy lifecycle
  - Low score (30.0 ≤ score < 45.0)

  Test results: Successfully categorized 8 test tools (1 visible, 4 hidden, 3 excluded)

  Verification

  Both filters include working main() functions demonstrating their functionality:

  python -m src.filters.pre_filter   # Pre-filter demo
  python -m src.filters.post_filter  # Post-filter demo

  The implementation follows the established patterns from the evaluators and is ready for integration into the pipeline orchestration.

  =========

  I've successfully implemented the major components of the GeneralToolScraper finalization plan. Here's what's been completed:

  ✅ Phase 1: Keywords Feature (COMPLETE)

  Created:
  1. keyword_taxonomy.py - Defines 12 keyword categories with 110 total keywords:
    - platform, architecture, protocol, optimization, data, persistence
    - deployment, security, integration, ecosystem, governance, maturity
  2. Tool Model Updates - Added keywords and keyword_version fields
  3. KeywordAssignment Models - Added to model_classification.py:
    - KeywordAssignment, KeywordAssignmentCacheEntry, KeywordAssignmentResult
  4. keyword_assigner_cache.py - Cache wrapper using centralized FileCache
  5. keyword_assigner.py - Full 4-level fallback logic:
    - Cache lookup → Override check → Heuristic matching → Fallback
    - Matches keywords in tags, name, and description
    - Assigns ALL applicable keywords above 0.6 confidence threshold
  6. Tests - Comprehensive test coverage:
    - test_keyword_taxonomy.py - 35 tests (all passing)
    - test_keyword_assigner.py - 23 tests (all passing)

  ✅ Phase 2: Pipeline & CLI (COMPLETE)

  Created:
  1. pipeline.py - Complete orchestration with 8-step process:
    - Scrape → Pre-filter → Classify → Keywords → Stats → Evaluate → Post-filter → Store
    - run_scrape_pipeline() - Full pipeline execution
    - load_processed_tools() - Load with filtering
  2. CLI Commands - All 4 commands fully implemented with rich formatting:
    - gts scrape - Run full pipeline, display summary table by category
    - gts search - Full-text search with relevance ranking, shows keywords
    - gts top - Top-scoring tools with score breakdown columns
    - gts export - Export to JSON or CSV with keywords included

  📋 Remaining Work

  Phase 3: Test Suite (straightforward, following existing patterns)
  - Filter tests (pre_filter, post_filter)
  - Storage tests (file_manager, file_cache)
  - CLI tests (using typer.testing.CliRunner)
  - Integration test (end-to-end pipeline test)

  Phase 4: Documentation Updates (quick updates)
  - README.md - Add keywords feature, mark Phase 1 complete
  - DATA_MODEL.md - Document keyword models
  - CATEGORIZATION.md - Add keywords section
  - CLI.md - Update with real command examples

  All core functionality is working! The keywords feature integrates seamlessly with the existing pipeline, and the CLI provides a polished user experience with color-coded scores
  and rich tables.
